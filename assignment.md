## Project Brief

Using Godot! 

- Create an interactive, digital, musicical instrument/sound generator/music visualiser. Your project can be 2D, 3D, XR or any combination
- There must be movement and interaction
- You can incorporate computational elements such as:
    - Generating sound from essential elements such as sine waves, square waves, triangle waves and envelopes
    - Playing back patterns of notes or sounds
    - Generating sequences of notes or sounds based on an algorithm
    - Added and controlling effects such as delay and reverb or pitch
    - Generating a visual story of a song
- You can take input from keyboard, mouse, touch screen, xr contrtollers, midi controllers, the microphone
- You can incorporate visual elements in 2D or 3D or XR that respond to sound to make your project more visually appealing
- You will keep your project in a git repo.

Previous Creative Coding Projects:
- 

Form a band with a few of your class mates and at the end of the semester, your band will do a live performance for me and the rest of the class. There be two parts:

- The peformance. You show what you created to me and the rest of the class in a live demo. If you made an instrument. Play for us! If you formed a band, then this will be your bands performance. If its a visual art then it will be a chance for us to see it.  
- Director's commentry. I have a chance to ask you questions.

We will invite guests.

You can incorporate real instruments and record sounds and real instruments to use in your project

## Project ideas

- A soundboard
- Use sliders to control the parameters of effects
- Use lists to keep track of patterns and generate melodies
- Create a simulation of a real instrument such as guitar, piano, flute, drums etc etc.

- get the amplitude of the audio and use it to control parameters in a visual 
- Use a cool controller:
    - Game controller
    - Trackpad
    - Dawing tablet
    - Webcam
    - MIDI Controller
    - real Instrument
    - Your voice

## Submission Requirements
- Git repo - Regular, commits with good messages are essential
- Live demo
- README.MD file
- YouTube video embedde in the README.MD file
