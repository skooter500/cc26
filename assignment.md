## Project Brief

Using Godot! 

- Create an interactive, digital, musicical instrument/sound generator/music visualiser. Your project can be 2D, 3D, XR or any combination
- There must be movement and interaction
- You can incorporate computational elements such as:
	- Generating sound from essential elements such as sine waves, square waves, triangle waves and envelopes
	- Playing back patterns of notes or sounds
	- Generating sequences of notes or sounds based on an algorithm
	- Added and controlling effects such as delay and reverb or pitch
    - Taking input from keyboard, mouse, touch screen, xr contrtollers, midi controllers, the microphone
	- Generating a visual story of a song
- You will keep your project in a git repo.

Form a band with a few of your class mates and at the end of the semester, your band will do a live performance for me and the rest of the class. There be two parts:

- The peformance. You show what you created to me and the rest of the class in a live demo. If you made an instrument. Play for us! If you formed a band, then this will be your bands performance. If its a visual art then it will be a chance for us to see it.  
- Director's commentry. I have a chance to ask you questions.

We will invite guests.

You can incorporate real instruments and record sounds and real instruments to use in your project

## Project ideas

- A soundboard
- Use sliders to control the parameters of effects
- Use lists to keep track of patterns and generate melodies
- Create a simulation of a real instrument such as guitar, piano, flute, drums etc etc.

- get the amplitude of the audio and use it to control parameters in a visual 
- Use a cool controller:
    - Game controller
    - Trackpad
    - Dawing tablet
    - Webcam
    - MIDI Controller
    - real Instrument
    - Your voice

## Submission Requirements
- Git repo - Regular, commits with good messages are essential
- Live demo
- README.MD file
- YouTube video embedde in the README.MD file

## Rubric

| Description | A | B | C | D | E | 
| ------------|----|----|----|----|----|
| Computational elements | Excellent use of Godot systems. Creation of modular, reusable Nodes. Use of Classes, emmitting signals. Creation of new systems. Algorithms that generate sounds or patterns or shapes and colors or the user interface. Loading and saving. Multi-player. Cloud backend. AI elements. Complex UI. Many new scripts and systems created. Novel controller. Great expressive range.  | Good use of a few Godot systems. A simple interface that directy triggers sounds. Use of signals and the UI system. A reasonable range of sounds | A simple project with a single scene with some buttons that create sounds - a sound board | Submitted a Godot proect with a minimimal amount of self created functionality and project runs | No submission or project doesn't run |
| Aesthetic elements | Sounds all generated or created or recorded. The instrument sounds cool and has a big expressive range. It can be discordant and sound harsh also. It doent have to obey any rules of how music or an instrument *should* sound. There is a beautiful and novel user interface for controlling the sound. All the colors, sounds and images are self created and look well. You do an impactful live performance solo or in your band and explain your work for the class | A simple but functional user interface for creating and controlling sounds. You do a great live performance | A very straightforward user interface like a button that creates a sound. A few assets from online sources | A basic Godot project that does something with some self created work. No performance | No performance or submission | 
| Documentation | Excellent project repo with regullar commented commits. README.MD file has all the required elements and youtube video | Decent repo with all the required elements, maybe a couple of minor errors or commits all bunched into a few days  | Commits all in one day. README.MD missing elements. Maybe missing video | Repo has issues and documentation incomplete |  No Git repo |
